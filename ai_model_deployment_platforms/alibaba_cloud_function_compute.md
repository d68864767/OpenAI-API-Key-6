# Alibaba Cloud Function Compute

Alibaba Cloud Function Compute is a fully-managed service that allows you to run your code without provisioning or managing servers. You can use Function Compute to build applications, extend existing ones, or create serverless backends.

## Features

- **No Server Management**: Function Compute automatically manages the infrastructure for you. There is no need to provision, patch, or manage servers.

- **Flexible Scaling**: Function Compute automatically scales your applications in response to traffic patterns. It can scale up to handle high traffic periods and scale down when traffic decreases.

- **Multiple Language Support**: Function Compute supports a wide range of programming languages including Python, Node.js, Java, and .NET Core.

- **Integrated with Alibaba Cloud Services**: Function Compute can be easily integrated with other Alibaba Cloud services like OSS, Log Service, and API Gateway.

- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**: With Function Compute, you only pay for the compute time you consume. There is no charge when your code is not running.

## Use Cases

- **Data Processing**: You can use Function Compute to process data in real-time or in batches. This can be useful for tasks like image processing, file compression, and log analysis.

- **Microservices**: Function Compute can be used to build microservices. Each function can be a separate microservice, allowing you to build and deploy services independently.

- **Web Applications**: You can build web applications with Function Compute. The service can handle HTTP requests and responses directly.

- **IoT Backends**: Function Compute can be used to build backends for IoT applications. It can process and analyze data from IoT devices in real-time.

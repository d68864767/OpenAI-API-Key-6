# Netlify Functions

Netlify Functions is a feature of Netlify's platform that allows you to run serverless functions on AWS Lambda without configuring API gateways, coordinating deployments, or setting up an AWS account. 

## Overview

Netlify Functions simplifies the process of deploying and using serverless functions. It abstracts away much of the configuration and deployment process, allowing developers to focus on writing their application code. 

## Key Features

- **Simplified Deployment**: Netlify Functions are deployed automatically when you push to your git repository. There's no need to manually configure API gateways or manage deployments.

- **Built-in CI/CD**: Netlify Functions are integrated with Netlify's powerful CI/CD capabilities. This means you can use your existing build and test tools with your serverless functions.

- **Local Development**: Netlify Functions can be tested and debugged locally using Netlify Dev, a powerful local development environment.

- **Integrated with the Netlify Ecosystem**: Netlify Functions are deeply integrated with the rest of the Netlify platform, including features like form handling, identity, and analytics.

## Use Cases

Netlify Functions can be used for a wide variety of applications, including:

- **APIs**: You can build your own APIs using serverless functions, without needing to manage a server or a database.

- **Background Tasks**: You can run background tasks in response to events like form submissions or user authentication.

- **Data Processing**: You can process data in real-time, like resizing images or processing form data.

## Getting Started

To get started with Netlify Functions, you need to have a Netlify account and a git repository for your project. Once you have these, you can start creating serverless functions using your favorite programming language.

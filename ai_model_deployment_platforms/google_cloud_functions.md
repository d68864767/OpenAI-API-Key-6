# Google Cloud Functions

Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services. With Cloud Functions you write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from your cloud infrastructure and services.

## Overview

Google Cloud Functions allows you to build and deploy services at the level of a single function, not at the level of entire applications, containers, or VMs. Functions are ephemeral, with their environment initialized when a function is invoked. After the function finishes execution, the environment is discarded.

## Key Features

- **No server management**: Google Cloud Functions abstracts away all the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on your code and build applications quickly.

- **Pay only while your function is executing**: With Google Cloud Functions, you're charged only for the compute time that you consume. There is no charge when your code is not running.

- **Automatic scaling**: Google Cloud Functions automatically scales up and down in response to events. You don't need to worry about capacity planning.

- **Integrated with Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Google Cloud Functions natively support events generated from various GCP services like Pub/Sub, Cloud Storage, Firestore, Analytics, etc.

## Use Cases

- **Data Processing / ETL**: You can use Google Cloud Functions to handle tasks such as image, video, or audio processing. You can also perform ETL tasks where you need to extract, transform, and load data into other systems.

- **Webhooks**: Cloud Functions can be triggered by an HTTP request to process incoming data, making them an ideal solution for handling webhooks.

- **Lightweight APIs**: Cloud Functions can be an easy way to deploy lightweight APIs that do not require a full backend server setup.

## Getting Started

To get started with Google Cloud Functions, you need to create a function in the GCP console, write your function code, and then deploy that function. For more information, check out the [official Google Cloud Functions documentation](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/).

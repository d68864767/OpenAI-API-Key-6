# Cloudflare Workers

Cloudflare Workers is a serverless execution environment that allows you to create entirely new applications or augment existing ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure.

## Overview

Cloudflare Workers provides a lightweight JavaScript execution environment that allows developers to augment existing applications or create entirely new ones without configuring or maintaining infrastructure. It is a part of Cloudflare's edge computing platform which is distributed to data centers in over 200 cities in more than 90 countries, reducing latency and improving performance.

## Key Features

- **Serverless**: Cloudflare Workers abstracts away server management and allows developers to focus on writing and deploying code.
- **Edge Computing**: Workers are distributed to data centers in over 200 cities, reducing latency and improving performance.
- **JavaScript**: Workers uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used in the Chrome browser and Node.js.
- **Integration with OpenAI API**: Cloudflare Workers can be used to deploy AI models using the OpenAI API, providing a scalable and efficient solution for AI model deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with Cloudflare Workers, you need to have a Cloudflare account. Once you have an account, you can create a new Worker from the Cloudflare dashboard. You can write your code directly in the dashboard or you can use Wrangler, the Workers CLI, to write your code locally and deploy it using the command line.

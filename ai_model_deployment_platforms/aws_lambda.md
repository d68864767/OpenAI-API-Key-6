# AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run your code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.

## Overview

AWS Lambda allows you to run your code without thinking about servers. You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda automatically scales your application by running code in response to each trigger. Your code runs in parallel and processes each trigger individually, scaling precisely with the size of the workload.

## Key Features

- **No server management**: AWS Lambda automatically runs your code without requiring you to provision or manage servers. Just write the code and upload it to Lambda.

- **Continuous scaling**: AWS Lambda automatically scales your applications in response to incoming request traffic. You don't need to worry about capacity planning.

- **Subsecond metering**: With AWS Lambda, you are charged for every 100ms your code executes and the number of times your code is triggered. You don't pay anything when your code isn't running.

- **Integrated security model**: AWS Lambda lets you set fine-grained access and execution policies at the function level. This means you can grant permission to your code to access other AWS resources.

## Use Cases

- **Data transformation**: AWS Lambda can be used to perform data validation, filtering, sorting, or other transformations for every data change in a DynamoDB table and load the transformed data to another data store.

- **Real-time file processing**: You can use AWS Lambda to execute code in response to triggers such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket, updates to a DynamoDB table, custom events generated by your applications, etc.

- **Real-time stream processing**: You can use AWS Lambda and Amazon Kinesis to process real-time streaming data for application activity tracking, transaction order processing, click stream analysis, data cleansing, metrics generation, log filtering, indexing, social media analysis, and IoT device data telemetry and metering.

## Getting Started

To get started with AWS Lambda, you need to create a Lambda function. This is a combination of your code and some associated settings. You can create a function by using the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.

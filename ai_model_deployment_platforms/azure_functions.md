# Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless computing service provided by Microsoft for the Azure cloud platform. With Azure Functions, you can write code that responds to events and scales automatically.

## Overview

Azure Functions allows you to run small pieces of code (called "functions") without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. With Azure Functions, you can use your development language of choice, such as C#, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, or Python, without worrying about complex infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **No server management**: Azure Functions takes care of the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus on writing and improving your code.

- **Pay-per-use pricing model**: With Azure Functions, you only pay for the time your code runs. You don't have to pay for idle VMs or reserve capacity in advance.

- **Automatic scaling**: Azure Functions can scale automatically to meet the demands of your workload. You don't need to worry about capacity planning.

## Use Cases

- **Real-time stream processing**: You can use Azure Functions to process data in real-time from sources like Azure Event Hubs or Azure IoT Hub.

- **Data transformation**: Azure Functions can be used to transform data, for example, by cleaning it, aggregating it, or reshaping it for further analysis.

- **Microservices architecture**: Azure Functions is a good fit for microservices because it lets you write a small piece of code for a single operation in a larger system.

- **Machine learning workflows**: You can use Azure Functions to prepare data for machine learning, run a machine learning model, or process the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with Azure Functions, you need an Azure account. Once you have an account, you can use the Azure portal, Azure CLI, or tools like Visual Studio Code to create and deploy your functions.

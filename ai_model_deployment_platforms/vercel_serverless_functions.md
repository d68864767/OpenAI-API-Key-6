# Vercel Serverless Functions

Vercel Serverless Functions is a serverless computing platform provided by Vercel. It allows you to deploy serverless functions that scale automatically and are billed on an as-used basis.

## Overview

Vercel Serverless Functions provide a simple, scalable way to deploy your serverless applications and APIs. With Vercel, you can deploy your serverless functions in a variety of languages, including Node.js, Python, and Go. The platform automatically scales your functions to meet demand, and you only pay for the compute time that your functions consume.

## Key Features

- **No server management**: Vercel Serverless Functions abstracts away all the underlying infrastructure, so you can focus on your code and build applications quickly.

- **Pay only while your function is executing**: With Vercel Serverless Functions, you're charged only for the compute time that you consume. There is no charge when your code is not running.

- **Automatic scaling**: Vercel Serverless Functions automatically scales your applications in response to incoming request traffic. You don't need to worry about capacity planning.

- **Integrated security model**: Vercel Serverless Functions lets you set fine-grained access and execution policies at the function level. This means you can grant permission to your code to access other resources.

## Use Cases

- **APIs and Microservices**: Vercel Serverless Functions are ideal for building APIs and microservices. You can write your functions in your preferred language, and Vercel will automatically handle the routing, scaling, and performance.

- **Real-time file processing**: You can use Vercel Serverless Functions to execute code in response to triggers such as changes to data in a database, updates to a file in a storage bucket, custom events generated by your applications, etc.

- **Data transformation**: Vercel Serverless Functions can be used to perform data validation, filtering, sorting, or other transformations for every data change in a database and load the transformed data to another data store.
